Compression = Coding + Modelling

Coding: How to store symbols.  
Modelling: Which symbols are more probable.

We want to code the most probable symbols in the least amount of bits. And vice versa.

Coding is solved.
Modelling is proved unsolvable.

For coding Arithmetic coding is used most commonly.
